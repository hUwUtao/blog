<!-- Hello World?!? -->
### `Who am I?`
> I'm just a random kid with a computer

### `What is this?`
> Place where I upload some random `markdown` about my reaction of something.

### `Why?`
> Bored and doing some random stuff

Conclusion:
- I made this blog to share my thoughts and ideas, sometimes about my reaction of something (games, music, ..., ~~maybe animes too?~~)
- I kept the source of all post on [github](https://github.com/hUwUtao/blog), and the blog project on ~~[github](https://github.com/hUwUtao)~~ too (not now xd)
